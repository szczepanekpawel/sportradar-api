### Howto
Open `localhost:3000` with chrome dev tools. Frontend code is in `views/index.hbs`, so for manipulating events you need to change code right there.

### Additional notes

- it's very nice idea to test skills ;)
- application works, but it's not completed and not perfect - and there is a little bit of cheating with the idea of shooting a goal every 10 seconds :)
- my idea of solving this problem is not perfect and would definitely not be suitable for a production solution
- tests are missing - I've already used all 4 hours
